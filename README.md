# About this project
PiWord is a simple password generator coded in Python with the intended use of being run on a Raspberry Pi not connected to a network.

# Future Plans
The main plan for PiWord is to modify it to allow a Raspberry Pi to print the generated password onto a piece of thermal paper (like a grocery store) for ease of use.
